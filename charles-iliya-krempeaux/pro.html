		<h3>AI Community</h3>
		<p>
		<abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> (short for “artificial intelligence”) is the intelligence of machines.
		Although often the topic of sci-fi, <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> is an important technique and tool used by specialists.
		</p>
		<p>
		Charles founded and led, what was at one time, the largest <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr>, machine learning, and data science community in western Canada.

		<h3>Show In A Box</h3>
		<p>
		The word “vlog” appears in most modern English dictionaries as both a <em>noun</em> and <em>verb</em>.
		</p>
		<blockquote>
		<p>
		vlog (noun):
		A weblog using video as its primary presentation format.
		</p>
		</blockquote>
		<blockquote>
		<p>
		vlog (verb):
		To post a video to a video weblog.
		</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>
		The origin of this word (“vlog”) goes back to an online community founded in 2004 — the “videblogging” mailing list.
		The noun “video blog” (short for “video weblog”) was (itself) shortened to “vlog”.
		</p>
		<p>
		(Historical context note — mailing lists were, during this era, one of the dominant forms of social-media.
		What most people think of as <em>social media</em> today (such as Twitter, Instagram, and others) were nascent technologies back then.
		Back then it was common for online communities to form on mailing lists.)
		</p>
		<p>
		This <em>video blogging</em> (i.e., <em>vlogging</em>) community was <strong>the first</strong> <em>video blogging</em> community.
		<sup class="citation"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://groups.yahoo.com/group/videoblogging"                          title="VideoBlogging Mailing List"></a></sup>
		<sup class="citation"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/vloggercon.com"                          title="Vloggercon (archived by the Wayback Machine)"></a></sup>
		<sup class="citation"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120212035225/http://www.vloggercon.com/" title="Vloggercon"></a></sup>
		<sup class="citation"><a rel="nofollow" href="http://archive.org/search.php?query=vloggercon"                        title="Vloggercon videos on the Wayback Machine"></a></sup>
		<sup class="citation"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.flickr.com/search/?q=vloggercon"                           title="Vloggercon on Flickr"></a></sup>
		</p>
		<p>
		This <em>video blogging</em> online community existed during a era of the Web &amp; Internet where the Web was still largely text and image based.
		Where video was still mostly not practical.
		But where a group of people, whose nexus was on the videoblogging mailing list, wanted to change things, and bring video to the Web and the Internet.
		</p>
		<p>
		Charles was part of this community — the “videblogging” community.
		</p>
		<p>
		In 2007, Charles (as a software engineer) created <strong>the first</strong> open-source vlogging software — VideoPress.
		</p>
		<p>
		Later in 2007, a small number of people from this <em>video blogging</em> community (including Charles) created <strong>the first</strong> open-source social-media software for video — it was called “Show In A Box” (<abbr title="Show In A Box">SIAB</abbr>).
		<sup class="citation"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://groups.google.com/group/show-in-a-box"                         title="Show in a Box mailing list"></a></sup>
		VideoPress became part of <em>Show In A Box</em>.
		</p>
		<p>
		Charles' contribution was as <em>lead software engineer</em>.
		He created the VideoPress vlogging software, which was a part of <em>Show In A Box</em>.
		</p>
		<p>
		This was an important technology for the era, as nothing like it existed at the time.

		<h3>Online Advertising</h3>
		<p>
		Today, online advertising is <em>more than</em> a USD $260+ billion industry.
		It is a staple of the Web and Internet
		—
		today's ubiquitous Web and Internet likely wouldn't exist without online advertising.
		</p>
		<p>
		The institution that makes online advertising a USD $260+ billion industry is — the <strong>ad network</strong>.
		The market places by which online advertising space is bought and sold.
		</p>
		<p>
		Charles (co-) created <strong>the first</strong> (online) <em>ad network</em>.
		</p>
		<p>
		As a software engineer, Charles was an early pioneer in the online advertising space.
		He used a confluence of software engineering, artificial intelligence (AI), and business skills to create it.
		</p>
		<p>
		The technology he created later was acquired by <strong>Microsoft</strong>.
		Microsoft later sold the technology to <strong>Facebook</strong>.
		</p>
		<p>
		He later went on to create ad networks for some of the largest companies in the U.S. and Canada.

		<h3>Mono Handbook</h3>
		<p>
		.NET is the technology platform
		that (via Unity) famous video games such as <em>Pokémon Go</em>, <em>Among Us</em>, and <em>Cuphead</em> were created with,
		that is a staple of fortune 500 enterprises software and product development, and
		that the C# &amp; F# programming languages are built on.
		</p>
		<p>
		Mono was the first open-source implementation of .NET.
		<sup class="citation"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.mono-project.com/"              title="Mono"></a></sup>
		(At the time, Microsoft's implementation of .NET was still closed-source.)
		</p>
		<p>
		The Mono Handbook is a guide (a textbook for software engineers) to the Mono runtime, related tools, libraries, and .NET itself, developed by the Mono team.
		<sup class="citation"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.mono-project.com/archived/team/" title="Mono Team (Archived)"></a></sup>
		</p>
		<p>
		From 2002 to 2003, Charles was part of the Mono team.
		<p>
		In 2003, Charles co-authored "The Mono Handbook".
		</p>
		<p>
		(He wrote the chapters on GTK#, GNOME# and Rsvg#.)
		</p>
		<p>
		Charles' contribution was as an <em>author</em> of a textbook for software engineers.

		<h3>Netscape Open Directory</h3>
		<p>
		Founded in 1994, Netscape was at one time one of the most famous companies on the Web — being the company behind the most popular web-browser at the time.
		Their flagship product, the Netscape web-browser, was for a long time the doorway to the Web for most people in the world.
		To many (perhaps most) people of the time, in their minds Netscape <em>was</em> the Internet.
		</p>
		<p>
		In 1998, Netscape created the <em>Netscape Open Directory</em> via an acquisition of NewHoo (which was previously named ‘Gnuhoo’)
		—
		a human created &amp; curated multilingual open-content directory of references to web-sites and web-pages.
		</p>
		<p>
		The <em>Netscape Open Directory</em> later rebranded to the <em>Open Directory Project</em> and <em><abbr title="directory mozilla">dmoz</abbr></em> (short for “directory.mozilla.org”).
		</p>
		<p>
		This was during an era of the Web when the problem of <em>searching</em> the Web hadn't been solved yet — during the surfing-the-web era.
		When human curated directories of references to web-sites and web-pages were still important.
		</p>
		<p>
		From 1997 to 2000, Charles was an editor on Netscape's (and later AOL Time Warner's) Open Directory Project (a.k.a. "dmoz").
		</p>
		<p>
		Charles' contribution was as an editor
		—
		where his work was used by corporations such as: Google, Alexa, AOL, Lycos, Netscape, and many many others
		(which were famous and well-known tech companies of that era)
		—
		and his work was used by hundreds-of-millions of people.
